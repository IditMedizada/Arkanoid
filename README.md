# Arkanoid 
Final product of a 6-part-semester project in Java.  
This project was coded as a six-part ongoing assignment on the 2nd semester of my 1st year at BIU.

### Description      
Arkanoid is a classic arcade game.
The game involves using a paddle to bounce a ball towards a wall of bricks, with the aim of destroying them all.
As the player progresses through the levels, the game becomes increasingly difficult, with new types of bricks and power-ups to contend with.

### Installing And Executing   
You must have Java SE 10 or higher installed on your machine.   
Install git on your computer.     
Open the command line and follow the following commands:    
``` 
git clone  https://github.com/IditMedizada/Arkanoid.git   
cd Arkanoid  
```
Run the game via any Java IDEA
